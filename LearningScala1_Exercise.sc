// EXERCISE

  // Write some code that takes the value of pi, doubles it, and then prints it within a string with
  // three decimal places of precision to the right.
  // Just write your code below here; any time you save the file it will automatically display the results!
  val Pi : Double = 3.14159265                      //> Pi  : Double = 3.14159265
  println(f"Twice the value of Pi is ${Pi*2}%.3f")  //> Twice the value of Pi is 6.283
